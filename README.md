# Hotel Booking Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights that can help improve business operations, customer satisfaction, and revenue management. The dataset includes information on bookings for both city hotels and resort hotels, covering aspects such as booking dates, length of stay, customer demographics, and cancellation trends. By leveraging this data, we aim to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic decision-making in the hospitality industry.

## Key Objectives
1. **Identify Booking Trends**: Analyze seasonal trends, peak booking periods, and customer preferences.
2. **Understand Cancellation Patterns**: Investigate factors influencing booking cancellations and strategies to mitigate them.
3. **Optimize Revenue Management**: Evaluate average daily rates (ADR) across different seasons and customer segments.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Explore the behavior of different customer types, including domestic and international travelers.
5. **Booking Channel Analysis**: Assess the performance of various booking channels in terms of revenue and cancellation rates.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains **119,390 entries** and **32 columns**, including:
- **Hotel Type**: City Hotel or Resort Hotel.
- **Booking Details**: Lead time, arrival date, length of stay, and room type.
- **Customer Information**: Number of adults, children, babies, and customer type (e.g., transient, group).
- **Cancellation Status**: Whether the booking was canceled or not.
- **Revenue Metrics**: Average daily rate (ADR) and total revenue generated.

For more details on the dataset, refer to the [dataset source](https://github.com/Rohan-Yele8788/HOTEL-BOOKING-DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/main/Hotel%20Bookings.csv).

## Key Insights
### 1. **Seasonal Trends**
- **Peak Seasons**: Highest booking volumes occur during summer (July-August) and holiday seasons (December-January).
- **Off-Seasons**: Lowest bookings are observed in February-March and September-October.

### 2. **Cancellation Analysis**
- **Cancellation Rate**: The average cancellation rate is 30-40%, with city hotels experiencing higher cancellations compared to resort hotels.
- **Lead Time**: Majority of cancellations occur for bookings made more than 90 days in advance.

### 3. **Revenue Optimization**
- **ADR Trends**: Peak seasons see a 20-40% increase in ADR, with higher rates on weekends and holidays.
- **Room Preferences**: Resort hotels generate higher revenue per booking, while city hotels rely on higher booking frequency.

### 4. **Customer Behavior**
- **Domestic vs. International Travelers**: Domestic travelers account for 60-70% of total bookings, while international travelers prefer resort hotels and tend to stay longer.
- **Booking Channels**: Online Travel Agents (OTA) contribute to 50-60% of bookings but have the highest cancellation rates. Direct bookings through hotel websites show higher customer loyalty.

### 5. **Operational Insights**
- **Overbooking**: City hotels overbook by 5-10% to compensate for cancellations, while resort hotels face fewer overbooking issues due to longer lead times.
- **Repeat Guests**: Only 3.9% of guests are repeat customers, indicating a low retention rate.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types for accurate analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Used visualizations to identify trends, such as booking distributions, cancellation rates, and revenue patterns.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Built models to predict cancellations and optimize pricing strategies.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and insights.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Visualization Tools**: Power BI, Tableau
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for predictive modeling.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/waseemofficial/Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
